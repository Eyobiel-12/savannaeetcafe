      "paragraph1": "Habesha Savanna Eetcafé was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to share the rich culinary traditions of Ethiopia with the people of Amsterdam. Our founder, Makeda Haile, grew up in Addis Ababa where she learned the art of Ethiopian cooking from her mother and grandmother.",
      "paragraph2": "After moving to the Netherlands, Makeda noticed a lack of authentic Ethiopian restaurants and decided to create a space where people could experience the unique flavors, aromas, and dining customs of her homeland.",
      "paragraph3": "What started as a small café has grown into one of the most beloved Ethiopian restaurants in the city, known for our commitment to authenticity, quality ingredients, and warm hospitality."

Our spices are imported directly from Ethiopia and Eritrea, ensuring the true flavors of dishes like Doro Wot, Kitfo, and our vegetarian combinations.",
      "paragraph2": "Central to Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine is injera, a sourdough flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. We make our injera fresh daily using teff flour, following the traditional fermentation process that gives it its distinctive tangy flavor.",
      "paragraph3": "Ethiopian and Eritrean dining is a communal experience, with various dishes served on a large piece of injera that serves as both plate and utensil. We encourage our guests to embrace this tradition, using pieces of injera to scoop up the flavorful stews and salads."
